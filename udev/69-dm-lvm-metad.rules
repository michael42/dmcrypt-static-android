# Udev rules for LVM.
#
# Scan all block devices having a PV label for LVM metadata.
# Store this information in LVMetaD (the LVM metadata daemon) and maintain LVM
# metadata state for improved performance by avoiding further scans while
# running subsequent LVM commands or while using lvm2app library.
# Also, notify LVMetaD about any relevant block device removal.
#
# This rule is essential for having the information in LVMetaD up-to-date.
# It also requires blkid to be called on block devices before so only devices
# used as LVM PVs are processed (ID_FS_TYPE="LVM2_member" or "LVM1_member").
